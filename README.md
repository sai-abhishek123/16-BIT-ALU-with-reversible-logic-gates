Designed a 16 BIT ALU by using reversible gates. The main gates that we had used were Toffoli and Feynmann gates. We had used reversible gates to design our ALU to reduce
power dissipation and to perform 2-way computations.

We simulated the circuit using Verilog Modules and obsereved the power dissipation and power consumption using Cadence Simulator 

We had published a journal paper in JETIR journal titled '16 BIT ARITHMETIC AND LOGIC UNIT USING REVERSIBLE GATES'
